            <p>The FCC is voting to kill net neutrality and the open Internet - there are huge stakes here! Our action at the FCC is getting their attention and it's getting bigger than they ever expected! But to pull off something this big takes money - and the folks we're counting on the come camp out with us can't just drop everything financially. With less than a few days away, there isn't much time left to save the Internet. Can you make a donation today?</p>

                <h1>FCC: We won&#39;t leave until the Internet is safe!</h1>
            

            

            

            <p>FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is already struggling to defend his new rules proposal to allow fast lane net discrimination by his corporate allies at Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T - <b>but we need to do something big to get the other FCC commissioners on our side.</b><br><br>
Courageous activists in Washington, DC set up camp outside the FCC building to protest the new net discrimination rules - <b>they’ll be there until the FCC drops the net discrimination rules.</b><br><br>
Not only are we protesting in DC, but we’re also helping organize similar encampments at other FCC branches in 27 other cities. <b>This is getting bigger than anything the FCC expected.</b> But in order for us to be successful, we need activists to come out and be a part of the action in DC.<br><br>
Here’s the best part: it’s already working. Before a single protester had even shown up at the FCC’s doorstep, we got a call from Chairman Tom Wheeler’s office asking what our message was, and saying they may be interested in meeting with us. That’s particularly interesting, since when we helped deliver more than 1 million net neutrality signatures to the FCC last month, they wouldn't meet with us.<br><br>
Now we know for sure we have the FCC’s attention, since they’ll have to walk past our encampment every day when they come to work. We've heard from our contacts in DC that Tom Wheeler was not expecting this kind of massive backlash to his net neutrality announcement last week. AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast have dozens of paid lobbyists surrounding the FCC daily, this is our way of fighting back.<br><br></p>

            <div id='victory'>Before the first day of the camp out, we've already seen two significant victories! <br>Two FCC Commissioners came forward to issue statements FCC Commissioner Clyburn issued a statement
questioning Chairman Tom Wheeler's new rule and supporting TRUE open
internet policy.
<br>
<br>In a statement at a meeting of the Chief Officers of State Libraries, Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel called on Chairman Wheeler and
her fellow commissioners to "delay our consideration of his rules by a
least a month. I believe that rushing headlong into a rulemaking next
week fails to respect the public response to his proposal."

<br>In a blog post at the FCC website, Commissioner Mignon Clyburn wrote that
"tens of thousands of consumers, companies, entrepreneurs, investors,
schools, educators, healthcare providers and others have reached out to
ask me to keep the Internet free and open."<br>

                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h1>
            

            

            

            <div id='faqs'>
<b>What/Who is the FCC?</b><br>
The FCC is Federal Communications Commission. They are the agency that governs and regulates the telecommunications industry in the United States (this includes the Internet). <br><br>

<b>What is net neutrality? Why does it matter?</b><br>
Net neutrality is the idea that the Internet should be accessible to anyone with no discrimination, no blocking, no censorship, and no "slow lanes". This principle has been a widely considered around the world as a standard for access to the Internet. Also called the "first amendment of the Internet", net neutrality is a defining free speech issue with the Internet becoming an essential part of society.<br><br>

<b>What is the FCC proposing to do to the Internet? Why is it important?</b><br>
The FCC is proposing new Internet policies that would allow Internet providers like Comcast, AT&amp;T, and Verizon, charge other websites, companies and other online services an extra fee - or else Internet users will have their access to those websites slowed down. This policy would make the Internet a "pay-to-play" service - basically if you don't have the extra money to pay Comcast or Verizon, your internet will be slowed down and put in the "slow lane". <br>
The Internet is a space where users freely share information and communicate. The premise that Internet access should be equal for all has been a globally adopted principle of the Internet called net neutrality. If we lose the net neutrality and the "openness" of the Internet, we'll lose our right to free speech and expression on the Internet.
<br><br>

<b>Why are you setting up camp outside the FCC/"occupying" the FCC?</b>
Because the open Internet and net neutrality is at stake! We're taking action to stop the FCC from going through with their proposal to create "slow lanes" for the everyday Internet users for extra profit for Internet providers like Comcast, Verizon &amp; AT&amp;T. <br><br>

<b>How can I help?</b><br>
<br>There are a number of ways you can help save the Internet!
<br><br>- If you can make it to DC, come join us at the FCC! We need as many people here as possible to demand the FCC to drop their proposal and protect net neutrality. If we have enough people out here - we can win this fight. <br>If you need help with getting to DC, we can help, send us a message and we'll get you to the FCC!
<br><br>- If you can't make it to DC, it's okay - you can still help! We have a list of things you can do to put pressure on the FCC, even if you're not physically here. We're using the Internet to fight back -<a href='/save-internet/#action'> click here to learn how.</a>
<br><br>- If you're a part of the press or you're a blogger, write a story about our encampment! We need this story to be spread as far and wide across the Internet to let people know what's happening and to put pressure on the FCC. We already have the FCC's attention, let's make sure they feel the heat. Here are some sample promotional materials (photos, e-mails, tweets) you can use - <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q1_afTUlVbWilRplOHAfxxoTQj_sQFPFOqL_JO-laRc/edit'> Click here </a></div>
